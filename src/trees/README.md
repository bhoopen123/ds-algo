# Trees

## Introduction
Before we jump into trees, let us first see what all types of Linear data structure are present.

 1 - Array

 2 - Linked List

 3 - Stack 

 4 - Queues

All of these data structures are basically collection of different kinds in which data is arranged in a sequential manner.

### Choice of data structure
Following are few parameters, 

- What needs to be stored?
- Cost of operations
  - minimize the cost of most frequently performed operations.
- Memory usage
- Ease of implementation
  - although this is the least considered item.

### Introduction to trees
Trees data structures are quite often used to represent hierarchical data.
                     
                     John 
                     (CEO)
                   /      \
                 /          \
               /              \
            Steve              Rama
            (CTO)              (President)
          /   |   \           /      \
        Lee  Bob  Ella       Tom     Raj
            /   \           /
          Sal   Emma       Bill

So, a tree data structures are non-linear data structures and provides efficient way of storing and organizing data which is naturally hierarchical. Of course there are other application as well where tree are implemented.

### Some terminologies used in trees data structure

                     1
                 /      \
                2        3
              / | \     /  \
             4  5  6   7    8
               / \    /
